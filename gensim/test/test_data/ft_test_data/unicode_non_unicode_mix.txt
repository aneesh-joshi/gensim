Калинка, калинка, калинка моя!
В саду ягода малинка, малинка моя!

Хэй! Калинка, калинка, калинка моя!
В саду ягода малинка, малинка моя!


Kinda given up on giving away
Now I thought about what I wanna say
But I never really know where to go
So I chained myself to a friend
Some more again
It didn't matter what they wanted to see
You thought he saw someone that looked just like me
I saw my memory that just never dies
We worked too long and hard to give it no time

Хэй! Калинка, калинка, калинка моя!
В саду ягода малинка, малинка моя!

Хэй! Калинка, калинка, калинка моя!
В саду ягода малинка, малинка моя!

Под сосную, под зеленою
Спать положите вы меня,

Ай люли, люли, ай, люли, люли,
Now I thought about what I wanna say
But I never really know where to go
So I chained myself to a friend
'Cause there's nowhere else I could go
And we will never be alone again
'Cause it doesn't happen everyday
Kinda counted on you being a friend
Kinda given up on giving away
Now I thought about what I wanna say
But I never really know where to go
So I chained myself to a friend
Some more again
It didn't matter what they wanted to see
You thought he saw someone that looked just like me
I saw my memory that just never dies
We worked too long and hard to give it no time

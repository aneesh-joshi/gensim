# Similarity Learning Develop
This is the folder where most of the Similarity Learning related files can be found.
Some of the SL models have been placed in `gensim.models.deprecated`

Evaluation Scripts have been moved to a new [repo](https://github.com/aneesh-joshi/Similarity-Learning-Evaluation-Scripts)
To run models, check [HowToRunModels.md](HowToRunModels.md)
